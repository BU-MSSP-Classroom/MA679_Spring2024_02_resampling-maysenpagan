### Ames House Data

```{r,echo=show_code}
library(AmesHousing)
?ames_raw
```

Let's revisit the AmesHousing data.  As we did in the previous class, I will split the data into before 2008 and after.  The data up to 2008 will be the training data and after 2008 will be the testing data.

```{r,echo=show_code}
ames_raw_2008=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`<2008,]
ames_raw_2009=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`>=2008,]
```

## Problem Set

### Bootstrap

We will investigate numerically the probability that a bootstrap sample of size n = 100 contains the jth observation. Here j = 4. We repeatedly create bootstrap samples, and each time
we record whether or not the fourth observation is contained in the bootstrap sample.

Here is the code to get you going
```{r,echo =TRUE,eval=FALSE}
store <- rep(NA, 10000)
for(i in 1:10000){
  store[i] <- sum(sample (1:100 , rep=TRUE) == 4) > 0
}
mean(store)
```

Comment on the results obtained.

### Default 1

In Chapter 4, we used logistic regression to predict the probability of default using income and balance on the `Default` data set. We will now estimate the test error of this logistic regression model using the validation set approach. Do not forget to set a random seed before beginning your analysis.

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~


### Default 2

We continue to consider the use of a logistic regression model to predict the probability of default using income and balance on the `Default` data set. In particular, we will now compute estimates for the standard errors of the income and balance logistic regression coefficients in two different ways: (1) using the bootstrap, and (2) using the standard formula for computing the standard errors in the `glm()` function. Do not forget to set a random seed before beginning your analysis.

(a) Using the `summary()` and `glm()` functions, determine the estimated standard errors for the coefficients associated with income and balance in a multiple logistic regression model that uses both predictors.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#
#
```

Your answer:

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.

(b) Write a function, `boot.fn()`, that takes as input the Default data set as well as an index of the observations, and that outputs the coefficient estimates for income and balance in the multiple logistic regression model.

Your code:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#
#
```

Your answer:

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~

(c) Use the boot() function together with your boot.fn() function to estimate the standard errors of the logistic regression coefficients for income and balance.

Your code:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#
#
```

#
#
```

Your answer:

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~


(f) We now would like to estimate the standard error of $\hat{\mu}_{med}$. Unfortunately, there is no simple formula for computing the standard error of the median. Instead, estimate the standard error of the median using the bootstrap. Comment on your findings.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#
#
```

Your answer:

~~~
Please write your answer in full sentences.


~~~



(g) Based on this data set, provide an estimate for the tenth percentile of medv in Boston census tracts. Call this quantity $\hat{\mu}_{0.1}$. (You can use the quantile() function.)

## Additional Material

### Predictive Modeling Platforms in R

There are few platforms in R that does predictive modeling.
These platforms are wrappers around other packages that makes it easy to do routine tasks.

- mlr3 (https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com)
- tidymodels (https://www.tidymodels.org/)
- caret (https://topepo.github.io/caret/)
- h2o (https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-r/docs/index.html)

```{r,echo=show_code}
# split the data
index <- sample(1:nrow(ames_raw), 0.7*nrow(ames_raw))
vars <- c("SalePrice","Lot Area","Gr Liv Area","Full Bath")
train <- ames_raw[ index, vars]
test  <- ames_raw[-index, vars]
colnames(train) <- make.names(colnames(train))
colnames(test)  <- make.names(colnames(test))

# mlr3 TaskRegr
train$SalePrice <- log(train$SalePrice)
```


#### Resampling using [mlr3](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com)

In MLR3 resampling for CV is
```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mlr_resamplings$get("cv")
rsmp("cv")
```

resampling for bootstrap is
```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mlr_resamplings$get("bootstrap")
rsmp("bootstrap")
```

They are called using `resample` function   
```{r,echo=show_code}
# load packages and data
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3learners)

# fit a model
task <- as_task_regr(train, target ="SalePrice",id = "ames_raw")
learner <- lrn("regr.lm", predict_type = "response")
resampler = rsmp("cv")

# Explicitly instantiate the resampling for this task for reproduciblity
set.seed(123)
resampler$instantiate(task)

rr = resample(task, learner, resampler)
rr$aggregate()
pred = rr$prediction()

# Repeat resampling with featureless learner
rr_featureless = resample(task, lrn("regr.featureless"), resampler)

# Convert results to BenchmarkResult, then combine them
bmr1 = as_benchmark_result(rr)
bmr2 = as_benchmark_result(rr_featureless)
bmr1$aggregate()
```

#### Resampling using [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/)


```{r,echo=show_code}
# load packages and data
library(tidymodels)
library(dotwhisker)
# Setup the model
rec <- recipe(SalePrice ~ ., data = train) 
clf <- linear_reg() 

folds <- vfold_cv(train, v = 10)
control <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)

wflow <- workflow() %>%
         add_recipe(rec) %>%
         add_model(clf)

# fit the models
lm_fit_rsmpl <- wflow %>% fit_resamples(folds,control=control)

collect_metrics(lm_fit_rsmpl)
prediction=collect_predictions(lm_fit_rsmpl)
```

#### Resampling using caret

```{r,echo=show_code}
# load packages and data
library(caret)

# fit the models
cv <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)
lm_model <- train(SalePrice ~ ., data = train, method = "lm", trControl = cv)

prediction=predict(lm_model,newdata = test)

```

#### Resampling  using h2o


#### Starting H2O

To use H2O you need to instantiate it.

```{r,echo=show_code,eval=FALSE}
library("h2o")
# nthreads specifies number of threads. -1 means use all the CPU cores.
# max_mem_size specifies the maximum amount of RAM to use.
localH2O <- h2o.init(nthreads = -1, max_mem_size="4g")
```

#### Serving the data to H2O

Since H2O is not in R, you need to tell it to use your data.

```{r,echo=show_code,eval=FALSE}
train_hf <- as.h2o(train)
test_hf <- as.h2o(test)
```

##### Cross validation

You can use K fold cross validation by specifying an integer to nfolds option.  With cross-validated model building, H2O builds K+1 models: K cross-validated model and 1 overarching model over all of the training data.  

Fitting GLM using 10 fold cross validation.

```{r,echo=show_code,eval=FALSE}
gaussian.fit.cv = h2o.glm(y = "SalePrice",                               #response variable 
                       x = c("SalePrice","Lot.Area","Gr.Liv.Area","Full.Bath"),
                          training_frame = train_hf, family = "gaussian",lambda = 0, nfolds = 10)
gaussian.fit.cv

```

The plot shows the variability of each coefficient among the 10 folds.  The red x is the final estimate. 
```{r,echo=show_code,eval=FALSE}
boxplot(t(sapply(sapply(gaussian.fit.cv@model$cross_validation_models, `[[`, "name"), function(x) h2o.coef(h2o.getModel(x)))),
        names = NULL)
points(1:4, coef(gaussian.fit.cv@model), pch = "X", col = "red")
abline(h = 0, col = "blue")

```
